# Savvy Coders Capstone Project Docs and Code

## Overview

This repository contains my Savvy Coders Development Bootcamp Capstone project docs, code, visual studio code dependencies (as similar from Savvy Coders Boilerplate Starter Kit).

## Capstone Project

My short term goal is to build a single page web application that will be sign-up portal for volunteers at local parks' (hypothetical) gardening activities/events. As me and my daughter have been volunteering at at our nearby park's gardening events - this project will compliment a hobby, passion and be useful to local county parks volunteer admins, garden volunteers. Initially, this will be designed as a proof of concept (POC), hypothetical application than a deployable website but with a fully functional frontend, backend stacks.

Consequently, given my professional background in Middleware Administration - my long term goal in attending Savvy Coders Coding Bootcamp is to learn how to support web applications end to end.  Upon completion of the course, I will be able to look at web applications in the holistic sense, which will allow me to analyze, troubleshoot, and optimize in a more educated manner.  I'm  passionate about optimization and likes to be proactive vs. reactive in my admin-support methods.

## Target Audience
- This project will be useful to local county parks volunteer-admins, garden volunteers (regular, occasional), horticulture students.
- This will compliment a hobby, passion recently ventured by me and my eldest daughter who is aiming to be a horticulturalist someday.

## Frontend, Backend Stacks

* Frontend: HTML, CSS, Javascript, ES6
*  Backend: Node.js, PostgreSQL
